# Wellcome to the Open Day at UoG!

Today we are introducing the Python Language based on the basic knowledge you are expected from High School.

Follow instructions by the speaker... In case you are lost, ask for help!
We are delighted to support you.

## Opening Pycharm

Press **Start Button** on Windows, and type Pycharm to boot our Python Programming tool.

## Get started

Have you ever run the Windows built-in Calculator?
Python as a programming language, can extend basic capabilities of a regular calculator.

Open built-in Calculator on Windows.

## Time to play with a Powerful Calculator: Python 

Before starting, follow the instructions by speaker to make some minor adjustments:

* Open **Run->Edit Configurations**
* In emerging window, press lower left **Edit Configuration Templates**
* Select **Python** and on the right pane tick **Execution->Run under console**
* Press **OK** to close any dialog

Then, to activate the **Python console**, just press **View->Tool Windows->Console**

## Basic data types.

Let us recap something very basic from your childhood.

### Integers.

Let's recap the properties of a __RING__ structure.

#### Addition

##### Unit

    1

##### Closed 

    1 + 2
    3 + 2 

##### Neutral Element  

    1 + 0

##### Inverse element  

    5 + (-5)

##### Associative Addition

    3 + (4 + 5)
    (3 + 4 ) + 5

##### Commutative Addition

    17 + 11
    11 + 17

### Product

#### Closed 

    1 * 2
    3 * 2 

#### Neutral Element  

    3 * 1

#### Associative 

    3 * (4 * 5)
    (3 * 4 ) * 5

#### Commutative 

    17 * 11
    11 * 17

> WHAT IS the problem WITH THE PRODUCT INVERSE OF INTEGERS?

    type(5)
    type(1/5)

> HAS ZERO number inverse?

    2/4
    1/0

### Blended (Add and Product)

#### Distributive

    14 * (1 + 2)
    14 * 1 + 14 * 2

### Booleans

#### Basic values
    True
    False

#### Conjunction (AND)

    True and False

#### Commutative

    False and True
    True and False

#### Associative  

    (False and True) and True
    False and (True and True)

#### Disjunction (OR) 

Can you follow for the disjunction?

    ?


    
### Strings (RAFA)

What about strings? 

    "Hello"
    "Rafael"

Do they behave as data above?


## Vectors (tuples in Python)

    (1 , 2 , 3)
    (1 , 2 , 3)

We can __name__ a given tuple

    a = (1, 2, 3)
    b = (1, 2, 3) 

What happen if 

    (1 , 2 , 3) + ( 1, 2, 3 )
    a + b 

It is not expected!!!

# YOUR CHALLENGES: 
1. DEFINE TIME TABLES IN PYTHON
2. DEFINE VECTOR SUM IN PYTHON

**Keep focus** , switch off your mobile, and follow explanations...

Follow explanations by speaker.
